# magic CSW for Trimui Brick
### ver. 0.1 ALPHA

magic CSW was invented to fill a niche of an accessible, minimal-but-comprehensive CSW (community software) solution for the Trimui Brick. It takes cues from several available and work-in-progress options for different consoles, with the aim of providing a cohesive solution specifically tailored for the Brick. It is a drag-and-drop solution (can be installed simply by extracting to a microSD card) intended to be as small and portable as possible.

## ALPHA NOTICE

This CSW is currently in an ALPHA state. It may not have complete functionality as detailed by this README, or any at all!
magic is my first solo development project. I welcome pull requests or bug reports via the issue tracker. Thank you for helping me test it!
